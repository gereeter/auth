G_OPRF = G_PAKE = ristretto255 (eventually ristretto448)
?? PBKDF = Argon2i
  Consider Argon2id, especially with 2FA (makes timing attacks essentially impossible since the pause includes waiting for a human)
?? HK = PBKDF of some form, presumably Argon2i
  Significantly reduced parameters
  ~1000x faster than for hashing the password
?? Hash = (usage-prefixed) SHAKE256
  Consider Blake2X, especially since Argon uses Blake2
  XOF is very useful
